# python chess
Chess made in free time. 
I'm pretty sure the game has all of the rules added to it. I tried to playtest it by playing in chess.com and using all of the same moves. 

Yes I even remembered to add an passant, castling and restricting piece movements in relation to king safety (i.e. you cannot move a piece out of kings way if another pawn is threatening it). 

Pawns can only promote to queens for now, but I quess that won't matter for most people.

The project uses tkinter to visualize the game

The game UI design is hilariously bad (by design). You can create your own images by replacing files in image folder.
